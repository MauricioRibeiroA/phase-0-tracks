<h3>Testing paragraph, emphasize and strong commands</h3>
<p>Every time you visit a <em>website</em>, your computer (the <strong>client</strong>) reaches out to another computer (the server) on the Internet and asks it for the documents, images, songs, and other files that you wanted. If you're wanting to play a song, your computer might reach out to one of Spotify's servers to request the right track. If you'd like to see what your friends are up to, your computer might contact servers owned by Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.</p>
