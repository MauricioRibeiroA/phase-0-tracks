At Dev Bootcamp, you’ll meet people like you who have shaped and expanded their careers by learning to code. You’ll benefit from a group of peers who have paved the path ahead of you and you’ll enjoy a community of fellow learners around you for both short-term and long-term support and success.</p>

What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
To help other developers understanding the page you created, to make more readable and accessible to people with disabilities and for the search engines. I believe the most useful is for the search engine.

What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
I think that browsers seesno difference between html elements so in this case he will display in order they were writter. Although if we are talking about all the elements in a website it will first run and display the informations inside the head tag.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
I learnt about snippets. They are pretty much useful and I´m already creating more snippets just know.

What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
The concept of snippets. Wasn´t because of the content but because of my english listening skill. I´ll keep training studying hard everyday.
