I already started study js and jquery studies at the beginning of the course. I was mixing all the new tools and skills in a game online in a website. I'm sending the file in html with the manipulation of events with jquery and the css to help with the style, so you can see the left panel as I created originally. The rest of the css doesn't matter for this activity. I just left there so you can see that I wrote the whole other pages and didn't just copied from the internet.
At the beginning of the course when we started with the html there was a reference about DOM and that makes me curious to know more about that and now I can understand better how important are the knowledgements for the frontdesk to manipulate events with in the concept of the client based requests and specially because of the compatibility with most of all browsers that exists in the market today.
