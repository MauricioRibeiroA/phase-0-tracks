In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?
A VPS is a machine (non necessarily real) that is designated to work as a server, to host the informations. As my experience with some VPS I know that they're very usefull for companies as they can save money, configurate their own machine setup (like firewalls) and don't need a lot of space. 

Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?
Because while working with the root you can make mistakes that's gonna affect all the system. The root user have the privilege to change any information inside the machine, just like the admin are for the GUI like windows. So instead of that you should configurate an user with the privileges that you need to work and you also have the sudo command for some process.

Five properties that should be interesting to manipulate in the page loading process:
Two interestings properties that I could learn was when I was manipulating sounds. I used one music in an object that should be activated just after the hovermouse action or the click because the music are too heavy to load at the beginning of the page and I could lose performance.

Other interesting properties are about the interactive menus with css. When you make a menu that shold interact with the users behaviour you can manipulate the opacity, the shadows, the option to slide to one side by the DOM as well. Its pretty much easier when you load this function before the user can have the opportunity to see the difference before and after the codes loads.
